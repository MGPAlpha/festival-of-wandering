Hostess: Excellent, it seems you are capable of defending yourself quite well.
Hostess: However, there will be times when your blade might not be enough to withstand the dangers of these woods.
Hostess: This is where we rely on <b>Mementos</b>, powerful items that enhance our bodies or perform great abilities.
Hostess: It seems you're holding one right now, the <b>Goliath Stone</b>. Press E or Right Bumper to use it.
Hostess: The <b>Goliath Stone</b> fires a volley of stones at your foes. Use it when you need to hit a strong foe from afar.
Hostess: Mementos are very powerful, but some require energy to cast. Recharge them by attacking foes with your blade. 
Hostess: Here, try it out on this dummy soul.
